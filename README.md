rails_application Cookbook
============================
This cookbooks installs the server-side Rails application.
Unlike the official OpsCode cookbooks, this cookbook has all of the possible
tweaks externalized in the form of attributes - it was intended that this
cookbook is used by a wrapper cookbook that provides the attributes which
configure the rails application per the requirements of the actual application.

This cookbook replaces the unicorn process supervisor to be upstart instead of
runit, it means that it will work on Ubuntu systems, later versions might allow
customizing the process supervisor as well.

Requirements
------------
Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and depends on several OpsCode official cookbooks that
actually do the majority of the work.

#### packages
##### This cookbook depends on several OpsCode cookbooks, namely -
- git
- ruby
- nginx
- unicorn
- application
- application_ruby
- application_nginx

#####  for the rails_application::database_credentials cookbook, you also need -
- database

Several of the above required minor modifications, all of these have pull
requests and tickets with OpsCode, but until these get accepted, forks that
include the modifications are available here -
